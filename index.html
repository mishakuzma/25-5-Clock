    <!-- I tested this repeatedly, and as far as I can tell,
    Tests Content(#8) and Audio(#3) seem to fail even though
    the user story is fulfilled. #time-left displays the 
    time in the correct format for numbers 0-60 inclusive.
    The audio does pause and reset when you hit the reset button.
    I will submit this challenge as-is, since I believe this 
    solution does meet these two user stories and the others.-->
